## Introduction

Hello World! We are team number 3.1 of CPSC 481, fall 2019 and welcome to our online portfolio for our group project, Barkipedia. Here, different stages of the project will be documented from start to end.

The purpose of this project is for students to have firsthand experience on the user-centered design process. Students are responsible for suggesting a novel idea and engineering a tool for direct human use based on that idea.

### What is User-Centered Design?

"An iterative design process that makes use of knowledge through investigation of a domain of work/play to create ideas and prototypes." (Tang, 2014)
In UCD, design decisions are made by considering the needs of the end-users. In order to understand and learn of these needs, designers employ a variety of investigative methods and tools. Designers utilize the gathered data to identify user requirements and establish design solutions. From there, they will evaluate the resulting design against the users' requirements and will either repeat a previous stage or go ahead and implement the design. During the UCD process and even beforehand, the main focus is always the user.
